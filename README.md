# Version-Control-With-Git-Final-Project
Create a Git repository with the commits shown in the commit graph and table shown in the course's final reading. This simulates a team building and releasing a product using the Gitflow workflow. The first release (v1.00) has only one feature. Soon after release, a bug was discovered and a hotfix (v1.01) was necessary.
